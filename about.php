                    Dian Mandiri (DIMAN) Foundation was established in 1998 with a
                    strong commitment to reduce poverty in Indonesia through
                    holistic Micro Enterprise Development (MED). In the first few
                    years, DIMAN started its service with only five staff members.
                    Today, with over 250 staff members, we are serving more than
                    40.000 micro entrepreneurs in Indonesia through the provision of
                    MICROFINANCE. <br />DIMAN exist to be an asset of local
                    communities. Our motto is "ASSIST THROUGH ACTION." Our strategy
                    is very practical. Sixty two percent of the workforce in
                    Indonesia is informal sector. Accordingly, they do not access
                    formal financial services to improve their livelihoods or
                    housing conditions since they do not have formal document or
                    collaterals. In response to this challenge, we provide micro
                    lending to micro entrepreneurs and help them improve their
                    livelihoods so that they can create more jobs in their
                    communities.
